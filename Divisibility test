To check whether the given number is divisible by 2, 4 or 8
Take a=1
b=1
c=1
d=1
e=1
f=a+10b+100c+1000d+10000e
g=a+10b
h=a+10b+100c
Create a textbox to type the question
create 5 input boxes linking a,b,c,d,e
Write a code using If and Mod commands
If(Mod(a,2)==0,"The number is divisible by 2","The number is not divisible by 2")
If(Mod(g,4)==0,"The number is divisible by 4","The number is not divisible by 4")
If(Mod(h,8)==0,"The number is divisible by 8","The number is not divisible by 8")
Create a check box to link steps13,14 and 15.
End
