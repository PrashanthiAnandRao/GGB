Prime factorisation by division method
Create a text box "Prime factorisation"
Create a slider a with max=99999 and minimum=2,increment=1
PrimeFactors(a) //creates a list l1 which gives all the prime factors of a
Create a list l2 using append command
Append(1,Sequence(Product(l1,k),k,1,length(l1)))
{Create a list of objects obtained by substitution of variables in the expression by elements        
        of corresponding lists. If the number of variables matches the number of lists, each variable 
            is taken from the following list. If the number of variables exceeds number of lists by one, 
                the last variable takes values from 1, 2, 3, ..., k where k is the length of the shortest 
                   list. Length of the resulting list is minimum of lengths of input lists.}
listA=Zip(a/k,k,l2)
Create a slider n with min=0 and max=length(l1), increment=1
    {Create a text that contains a table of the list objects.}
TableText({First(l1,n)},"rv")
TableText({First(listA,n+1)},"|100_1vr")
FormulaText(a)
Create a input box linking a
End.
